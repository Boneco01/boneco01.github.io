							<h3 class="major">Skills</h3>
							<p>Thanks to a variety of experience, I have refined my skills so it matches my needs and allows me to adapt to any workflow.</p>
							<p>Programming being my most comfortable asset, I can freely explore the conception of systems and mechanics while keeping in mind the constraints and means required by these ideas. As such, I'm able to quickly determine the efforts required to develop certain tasks, what can be made easily and what requires more in-depth study.</p>
							<p>These affinities naturally led me to enjoy and specialize in the making of game systems that are highly tweakable, independant and efficient. I love to create, but even more to organize my work so it is clear and easy to sustain, whether in its very design than the resources made alongside.</p>
							<p>Finally, I also have a true interest in the gamefeel aspects of a game, also I have great experience when it comes to the implementation of these important details throughout development.</p>
							
							<h3 class="major">Motivations</h3>
							<p>Games have always been part of my life. Whether it be through children's play, sports, board games or of course video games, even daily tasks can be seen as such. Our world is full of wonders and I believe that it only requires a bit of fantasy to experience it the best way possible.</p>
							<p>It was only natural to start learning development, as it seems to me like the most fun and practical way to bring my ideas to life. I just fell in love with its gymnastics of the mind, overcoming conceptual and technical challenges became a true hobbie.</p>
							<p>Curious and willing, I'm always looking for new notions to learn, new concepts to explore and stuff to create. More than anything, I love to share my work and learn from others, as its feels like it gives sense to the act of creation.</p>
