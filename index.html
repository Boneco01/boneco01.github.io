							<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/aboutme.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Games have always been part of my life. Whether it be through children's play, sports, board games or of course video games, even daily tasks can be seen as such. Our world is full of wonders and I believe that it only requires a bit of fantasy to experience it the best way possible.</p>
							<p>It was only natural to start learning development, as it seems to me like the most fun and practical way to bring my ideas to life. I just fell in love with its gymnastics of the mind, overcoming conceptual and technical challenges becoming a true hobbie.</p>
							<p>Curious and willing, I'm always looking for new notions to learn, new concepts to explore and stuff to create. More than anything, I love to share my work and learn from others, as its feels like it gives sense to the act of creation.</p>
